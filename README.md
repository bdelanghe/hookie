# Hookie: Unravel the Words! 🎲🔤

Welcome to Hookie! This is a fascinating twist on Scrabble Hooks with a touch of reverse charm. This project leverages the robust boardgame.io framework with the power of React, Redux, and WebSockets to create an engaging and strategic gameplay. 🌐💻🚀

## Hookie: The Reverse Scrabble Hooks 🔄

Imagine a game of Scrabble where you peel off layers of words rather than constructing them. This is Hookie! The game begins with a word sprouting from the center star. As players, you carefully deconstruct words, unraveling them until you're left with a core. Once there are no subwords left to discover, it's time to place a new word. This cycle repeats until you've exhausted all the letters in the Scrabble bag. 🎁⭐🔄👜
